## JUICE: Super-Fast AI Chatbot

Leveraging D-ID, OpenAI, and ElevenLabs APIs, JUICE delivers an AI chatbot experience with lightning-fast responses.

## Project Overview

JUICE is an AI chatbot developed using cutting-edge AI technology, offering ultra-fast response times. It recognizes user input speech in real-time, enabling natural and smooth conversations.  JUICE addresses the challenge of slow response times often found in traditional chatbots, minimizing delays and creating a stress-free communication experience.

**Target Users:**

- Individuals seeking a natural conversational experience with an AI chatbot
- Users dissatisfied with the response speed of traditional chatbots
- Those interested in services powered by the latest AI technologies

**Development Background:**

In recent years, AI-powered chatbots capable of engaging in natural conversations with humans have gained significant attention. However, many existing chatbots face challenges such as slow response times and unnatural speech patterns. JUICE was developed to address these issues. By combining the power of D-ID, OpenAI, and ElevenLabs APIs, JUICE achieves fast and natural communication, providing users with a stress-free experience.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Speech Recognition:** Utilizes the browser's Web Speech API to convert user speech into text in real-time.
- **Natural AI Conversations:** Leverages OpenAI's GPT model (GPT-4o mini) to generate natural and human-like responses based on user input.
- **Fast Speech Synthesis:**  Employs ElevenLabs API (Turbo v2.5) to synthesize high-quality speech at high speeds, giving voice to AI characters. Generated synthetic speech is temporarily uploaded to tmpfiles.org.
- **Video Generation with D-ID:** Creates realistic videos synchronized with speech, enhancing the human-like feel of the conversation.

## Features

- **Super-fast Response Times:**  Offers significantly faster responses compared to traditional chatbots.
- **Natural and Smooth Conversations:** Advanced AI technology delivers a natural conversational experience, making interactions feel like talking to a real person.
- **High-Quality Audio and Video:** Utilizes ElevenLabs and D-ID APIs to generate high-quality audio and video, creating a realistic communication experience.
